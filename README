Dancer-Plugin-ProxyPath

If you deploy a Dancer app behind a proxy using Apache's mod_proxy, 
it is likely that anything in your public directory will break 
(images, javascripts, etc). To prevent this you can use mod_proxy_html, 
which rewrites links inside html. But this has limitations related to stylesheets,
scripts and element style declarations. To get around this, this module
provides a proxy object which knows how to write paths from the 
user's perspective. 

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

CONFIGURATION

you will need to pass a header along to the proxied server
telling it what the base path was. If you are running apache the 
following is along the right lines:

    RequestHeader append Request-Base /application-root

You can choose any other header, but don't then forget to 
set the name of the header in the webapp's config.
