Dancer-Plugin-ProxyPath

If you deploy a Dancer app behind a proxy using Apache's mod_proxy, 
it is likely that anything in your public directory will break 
(images, javascripts, etc). To prevent this you can use mod_proxy_html, 
which rewrites links inside html. But this has limitations related to stylesheets,
scripts and element style declarations. To get around this, this module
provides a proxy object which knows how to write paths from the 
user's perspective.
